We currently have 4 types of users in this system 
('admin', 'support-worker', 'participant', 'guardian').Please, kindly analyze all the code. 
When a new user registers, there are atleast 2 steps - 'form', 'verification'. 
Once a new user registers, I want a situation whereby when the user passes the 'verfication' step, 
he's now a real user in the app i.e, he has been authentication and can now be redirected to his 
dashboard. But for a 'support-worker', after he passes the 'verification' step, he is also 
authenticated and identify as a real user but before he goes to his dashboard, i want a check if 
he has setup his profile which is the SupportWorkerSetup.tsx component. If he hasn't setup his 
profile, he should be redirected to the SupportWorkerSetup flow otherwise, he should be redirected 
to his dashboard. So, you can make SupportWorkerSetup.tsx a page that can only be accessible by a 
'support-worker' only. SupportWorkerSetup.tsx should be a single page on its own - the screen only 
comes up when a newly registered 'support-worker' hasn't setup their profile.
